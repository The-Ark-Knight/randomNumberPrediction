# Random Number Prediction Model

## Overview

The Random Number Predictor is a Python project that utilizes machine learning to predict the next number in a sequence generated by a random process. This project is designed to showcase the implementation of a simple online learning approach, where the model is continuously updated with new datasets, retaining and improving its knowledge over time.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Model:** The project employs a basic linear regression model for simplicity. This model is updated with both historical and new datasets to make predictions about the next number in the sequence.

- **Online Learning:** The script supports online learning, allowing the model to accumulate knowledge from past datasets and incorporate new information each time the code is run.

- **Random Number Generation:** Actual and predicted next numbers are displayed, providing insights into the model's performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-number-predictor.git
   cd random-number-predictor
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```
   python randomPredictor.py
   ```

3. **Explore and Experiment:**
   - Observe actual and predicted next numbers before and after each update.
   - Experiment with different datasets and explore the model's adaptability over time.
